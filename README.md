## 💻 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mahashweta-Dutta/image-slider.git

2. **Open in Browser**
Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

⚙️ **How It Works**
The script.js file cycles through images every 3 seconds.

The "Next" and "Previous" buttons allow manual control.

A background video plays in a loop using the <video> tag.

The style.css file ensures smooth transitions, responsive design, and a soft modern aesthetic.

📌 **Customization**
Add or replace images in the images/ folder.

To change the background video, replace vdo1.mp4 with your own.

You can modify the timer or transition style via the JavaScript or CSS files.
